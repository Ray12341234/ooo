00:10.920 --> 00:12.510
<b>It's morning...</b>

00:13.920 --> 00:16.630
<b>Bell fell off the bed again...</b>

00:16.630 --> 00:20.470
<b>C'mon, Hinata, why not?</b>

00:20.470 --> 00:22.470
<b>Wake up, Bell.</b>

00:22.470 --> 00:23.760
<b>Bell!</b>

00:26.920 --> 00:29.010
<b>G'morning, Hinata.</b>

00:29.010 --> 00:32.970
<b>Morning. I'll go make breakfast,
so you get changed.</b>

00:32.970 --> 00:34.590
<b>Change...</b>

00:37.050 --> 00:40.220
<b>A-at least wait until I leave the room!</b>

01:43.840 --> 01:45.670
<b>Let's dig in!</b>

01:47.220 --> 01:49.590
<b>It's been a week since Bell got here.</b>

01:49.590 --> 01:52.510
<b>And I've gotten kinda used to living with her.</b>

01:54.970 --> 01:56.760
<b>Alright, I'll be back later.</b>

01:56.760 --> 01:59.970
<b>You're leaving me all by my lonesome again...</b>

01:59.970 --> 02:02.590
<b>Well, I am a student, so...</b>

02:02.590 --> 02:04.970
<b>Maybe you should try getting out
every once in a while, too.</b>

02:04.970 --> 02:05.840
<b>Huh?</b>

02:05.840 --> 02:09.050
<b>All you've done since you got here
is read books.</b>

02:09.050 --> 02:11.050
<b>You haven't gone exploring.</b>

02:11.050 --> 02:13.010
<b>I think you might learn more
by seeing some stuff in person.</b>

02:14.130 --> 02:17.340
<b>Hm... you may have a point...</b>

02:17.670 --> 02:20.840
<b>But the thing is, us elves...</b>

02:20.840 --> 02:25.670
<b>We can be particularly sensitive to fluctuations
in the emotions and attitudes of living beings.</b>

02:25.670 --> 02:26.840
<b>The nerve of that dark elf,
out in broad daylight...</b>

02:26.840 --> 02:28.550
<b>Oh, look at that cute dark elf!</b>

02:26.840 --> 02:28.550
<b>The nerve of that dark elf,
out in broad daylight...</b>

02:28.550 --> 02:30.590
<b>Humans are complex.</b>

02:30.590 --> 02:35.220
<b>The good feelings and the bad get
all jumbled up and flow right into us.</b>

02:35.630 --> 02:38.550
<b>Sometimes it can even make us ill.</b>

02:38.550 --> 02:39.670
<b>Bell...</b>

02:40.300 --> 02:43.550
<b>I got pretty used to it when we
traveled as a party, but...</b>

02:43.550 --> 02:45.840
<b>Can you give me just a little longer?</b>

02:46.470 --> 02:50.300
<b>Of course. I'm sorry for trying to rush you.</b>

02:50.970 --> 02:53.510
<b>And-by-the-way!</b>

02:53.840 --> 02:57.630
<b>The feelings in your heart are
very compassionate and warm!</b>

02:57.630 --> 02:59.420
<b>I could bask in them forever!</b>

02:59.420 --> 03:01.340
<b>B-Bell! I'm gonna be late!</b>

03:01.920 --> 03:05.300
<b>Okay, I'll check out some more
interesting books for you to read!</b>

03:05.300 --> 03:06.550
<b>See you later!</b>

03:06.550 --> 03:08.260
<b>Have a good day!</b>

03:14.720 --> 03:17.010
<b>If she's going to live in this world,</b>

03:17.010 --> 03:19.380
<b>it's important for her to
interact with people...</b>

03:19.380 --> 03:20.670
<b>Hey, Sunohara.</b>

03:20.670 --> 03:24.300
<b>But I can't go dragging her
out of the house if she isn't ready...</b>

03:24.300 --> 03:26.670
<b>U-um, Sunohara?</b>

03:27.220 --> 03:29.840
<b>Oh, my bad! I was kinda lost in thought...</b>

03:29.840 --> 03:32.510
<b>You've been here a lot lately. Studying?</b>

03:32.510 --> 03:35.170
<b>Well, this dark elf- er, I mean...</b>

03:35.170 --> 03:37.170
<b>I have a friend visiting from overseas.</b>

03:37.170 --> 03:39.590
<b>They mentioned wanting to
learn about Japan, so...</b>

03:39.590 --> 03:41.010
<b>Huh...</b>

03:42.550 --> 03:47.130
<b>"This is where humans of the same age
receive an education together."</b>

03:47.130 --> 03:49.470
<b>Elven communities don't have that,</b>

03:47.880 --> 03:49.880
<b>Let's Learn!</b>

03:47.880 --> 03:49.880
<b>How Society Works</b>

03:49.470 --> 03:53.590
<b>but I feel like there was something
similar in the larger human towns...</b>

03:56.800 --> 03:59.220
<b>I need more Hinata Time.</b>

03:59.550 --> 04:03.010
<b>Oh, I hope Hinata comes home soon!</b>

04:03.010 --> 04:05.010
<b>I wonder what's for dinner tonight...</b>

04:05.010 --> 04:07.470
<b>Hinata's cooking is so yummy!</b>

04:07.470 --> 04:11.090
<b>Mm, but if I had the choice,
I'd rather taste Hinata...</b>

04:11.380 --> 04:13.090
<b>Oh well.</b>

04:13.090 --> 04:14.260
<b>Ta-da!</b>

04:14.260 --> 04:16.970
<b>Bell's special Hinata talisman!</b>

04:19.420 --> 04:21.090
<b>My precious Hinata.</b>

04:21.090 --> 04:23.010
<b>What are you up to-</b>

04:25.050 --> 04:26.550
<b>O-owie...</b>

04:26.550 --> 04:28.300
<b>Sorry, Sunohara, are you oka-</b>

04:29.670 --> 04:31.340
<b>I am so sorry!</b>

04:31.340 --> 04:33.970
<b>After you went to the trouble of
helping me organize the books...!</b>

04:33.970 --> 04:37.260
<b>I-it's fine. It was just an accident.</b>

04:44.130 --> 04:46.380
<b>I admire you, Sunohara.</b>

04:46.380 --> 04:49.220
<b>Always going out of your way to help people...</b>

04:49.220 --> 04:51.510
<b>All I do is screw things up.</b>

04:51.510 --> 04:53.090
<b>That's not true.</b>

04:53.090 --> 04:56.260
<b>You put your all into everything.
I respect that about you.</b>

05:01.090 --> 05:01.840
<b>Hey, Sunohara? Would you be interested in-</b>

05:01.840 --> 05:03.970
<b>Crap! I'm going to miss the supermarket sale!</b>

05:01.840 --> 05:03.970
<b>Hey, Sunohara? Would you be interested in-</b>

05:03.970 --> 05:04.380
<b>Crap! I'm going to miss the supermarket sale!</b>

05:04.380 --> 05:07.380
<b>Gotta run, Mochida. See you tomorrow!</b>

05:07.510 --> 05:10.090
<b>O-okay! See you tomorrow...</b>

05:18.970 --> 05:20.170
<b>I'm home!</b>

05:23.420 --> 05:25.840
<b>B-Bell? What's wrong?</b>

05:25.840 --> 05:27.260
<b>Hinata...</b>

05:27.720 --> 05:30.090
<b>Who was that woman?</b>

05:30.090 --> 05:31.720
<b>Wh-which woman...?</b>

05:32.510 --> 05:35.970
<b>The one who was sitting on top of you...</b>

05:35.970 --> 05:38.170
<b>Are you talking about Mochida?</b>

05:38.170 --> 05:39.800
<b>How did you know that-</b>

05:40.420 --> 05:42.550
<b>A talisman? You were spying on me-?!</b>

05:42.550 --> 05:43.670
<b>I LOVE you!</b>

05:43.920 --> 05:45.970
<b>I'll make that woman pay...</b>

05:45.970 --> 05:49.470
<b>That cutesy, "innocent as a lamb"
face of hers doesn't fool me...</b>

05:49.470 --> 05:50.590
<b>Bell...?</b>

05:51.380 --> 05:54.260
<b>...what I'll do.</b>

05:54.260 --> 05:55.380
<b>Huh?</b>

05:55.630 --> 05:58.420
<b>I'm going to go to school with you!</b>

05:58.420 --> 06:00.720
<b>I won't let anyone have you!</b>

06:00.720 --> 06:01.630
<b>What?!</b>

06:02.420 --> 06:06.340
<b>That's right. There's no need to waste
my time being sneaky about it!</b>

06:06.340 --> 06:10.670
<b>I'll crush anyone who comes near you
into pieces with my own two hands...</b>

06:10.670 --> 06:11.920
<b>Hinata!</b>

06:11.920 --> 06:13.420
<b>Y-yes?</b>

06:13.760 --> 06:16.470
<b>Don't worry. I'll keep you safe.</b>

06:18.300 --> 06:22.920
<b>If it gets Bell out of the house,
everything will be fine... hopefully.</b>

06:24.010 --> 06:27.170
<b>But... I have a feeling things are
going to get complicated...</b>

06:32.670 --> 06:35.010
<b>I-I'm from another world.</b>

06:35.010 --> 06:36.420
<b>My name is Mariabell.</b>

06:36.420 --> 06:38.420
<b>I-it's nice to meet you.</b>

06:39.090 --> 06:41.720
<b>Whoa, she's an incredible cosplayer!</b>

06:41.720 --> 06:43.340
<b>So cute!</b>

06:43.920 --> 06:45.420
<b>Cosplay?</b>

06:45.420 --> 06:47.260
<b>They're okay with that explanation?</b>

06:47.670 --> 06:50.300
<b>Well, I'm glad you didn't have any issues
with the transfer process.</b>

06:50.300 --> 06:51.420
<b>I know, right?</b>

06:51.420 --> 06:54.470
<b>I wanted to avoid "brainwashing"
anyone if I could help it.</b>

06:54.670 --> 06:56.590
<b>A disturbing choice of words...</b>

06:56.590 --> 06:59.380
<b>Maybe I ought to just leave
well enough alone...</b>

06:59.380 --> 07:01.130
<b>Anyways, Hinata...</b>

07:01.420 --> 07:03.420
<b>Here, open wide!</b>

07:03.420 --> 07:06.420
<b>B-Bell, this isn't an appropriate place to...</b>

07:06.420 --> 07:11.170
<b>What? But if I do this, no one will
be tempted to flirt with you.</b>

07:11.170 --> 07:12.670
<b>Flirt with me...?</b>

07:12.670 --> 07:16.670
<b>I'd like you to make friends with
the people of this world, Bell...</b>

07:16.670 --> 07:19.170
<b>I'm perfectly content as long as I have you.</b>

07:19.510 --> 07:22.550
<b>She's as intense as ever...</b>

07:22.720 --> 07:24.260
<b>C'mon, now!</b>

07:24.260 --> 07:26.590
<b>E-excuse me, Sunohara...</b>

07:26.920 --> 07:28.470
<b>Oh, Mochida.</b>

07:28.470 --> 07:31.470
<b>About those books you
checked out the other day...</b>

07:32.300 --> 07:34.260
<b>B-Bell! Uh, I'll introduce you.</b>

07:34.260 --> 07:36.300
<b>This is Mochida, our library assistant.</b>

07:36.300 --> 07:39.920
<b>Sakura Mochida.
I've heard a lot about you-</b>

07:40.550 --> 07:41.550
<b>Bell?!</b>

07:41.550 --> 07:44.010
<b>This is the ass that sat on Hinata's face...</b>

07:44.510 --> 07:46.380
<b>Wh-what on earth are you doing?!</b>

07:46.380 --> 07:49.090
<b>You used these curves to seduce Hinata.</b>

07:49.090 --> 07:50.300
<b>Unacceptable...</b>

07:50.300 --> 07:52.170
<b>S-seduce him?!</b>

07:52.170 --> 07:53.760
<b>What are you talking about?!</b>

07:53.760 --> 07:56.090
<b>Hinata belongs to me alone.</b>

07:56.090 --> 07:57.970
<b>Please, no more...!</b>

08:06.880 --> 08:11.090
<b>Anyone who dares come between
Hinata and me deserves to be-</b>

08:11.090 --> 08:11.880
<b>BELL!</b>

08:14.380 --> 08:16.880
<b>What you're doing isn't okay, Bell.</b>

08:16.880 --> 08:19.220
<b>Y-you don't understand, Hinata.</b>

08:19.220 --> 08:21.550
<b>That wasn't what I...</b>

08:22.300 --> 08:23.670
<b>Stop it...</b>

08:23.670 --> 08:26.510
<b>Please don't look at me like that!</b>

08:27.340 --> 08:28.760
<b>I didn't mean it!</b>

08:28.760 --> 08:30.670
<b>Ah, Bell! Wait-!</b>

08:36.550 --> 08:37.800
<b>Bell...</b>

08:37.800 --> 08:39.550
<b>I'm sorry, Hinata.</b>

08:39.550 --> 08:44.050
<b>I was so terrified of her taking you away
from me that I acted without thinking...</b>

08:44.050 --> 08:48.590
<b>The last thing I ever wanted was for you
to look so disappointed in me.</b>

08:48.590 --> 08:52.010
<b>All I wanted was for Bell to get
a better feel for this world,</b>

08:52.010 --> 08:53.720
<b>but I guess I shouldn't have-</b>

08:53.720 --> 08:55.720
<b>M-Mariabell!</b>

08:56.090 --> 08:57.090
<b>You?</b>

08:57.090 --> 08:58.050
<b>Mochida...?</b>

09:02.840 --> 09:06.510
<b>Mariabell, there's something
you and I need to discuss!</b>

09:06.800 --> 09:08.340
<b>Discuss?</b>

09:08.340 --> 09:10.970
<b>Look, if it's about what I did, I'm sorry-</b>

09:10.970 --> 09:13.470
<b>Tell me, and be honest: Was that magic?!</b>

09:18.920 --> 09:20.050
<b>I suppose so-</b>

09:20.050 --> 09:22.920
<b>No way! So you weren't lying about
being from another world!</b>

09:22.920 --> 09:27.470
<b>Um, actually, I've loved manga and
anime for my whole life,</b>

09:27.470 --> 09:29.300
<b>and I've always imagined
how wonderful it'd be</b>

09:29.300 --> 09:31.090
<b>if magic and all that
fantasy stuff were real!</b>

09:31.090 --> 09:34.130
<b>I was afraid of telling my friends
since they might think it's cringe,</b>

09:34.130 --> 09:36.340
<b>so I've kept quiet about it lately...</b>

09:36.590 --> 09:38.970
<b>But when I saw you this morning,</b>

09:38.970 --> 09:42.970
<b>I was so happy 'cause it's like,
"Ah, elves are real!"</b>

09:43.760 --> 09:47.300
<b>Plus, you're gorgeous and
you've got beautiful hair and skin!</b>

09:47.300 --> 09:49.800
<b>I just couldn't stop myself
from talking to you!</b>

09:49.800 --> 09:51.170
<b>A-anyway...</b>

09:51.170 --> 09:53.670
<b>Would you consider being my fwiend?!</b>

09:59.380 --> 10:01.260
<b>...Is that a no?</b>

10:05.510 --> 10:08.260
<b>I don't care if she is the hero's companion.</b>

10:08.260 --> 10:11.090
<b>I'd never want to hang around
someone like her.</b>

10:17.840 --> 10:19.420
<b>Did you just stutter? That's hilarious!</b>

10:19.420 --> 10:20.090
<b>Huh?</b>

10:19.420 --> 10:20.090
<b>Did you just stutter? That's hilarious!</b>

10:22.880 --> 10:26.090
<b>I guess it's really not
that important anymore.</b>

10:26.090 --> 10:27.840
<b>Just "Bell" is fine.</b>

10:27.840 --> 10:29.590
<b>Nice to meet you, Sakura.</b>

10:32.260 --> 10:34.170
<b>Yeah, nice to meet you!</b>

10:35.090 --> 10:37.920
<b>Hey Bell, tell me more about
the world you came from!</b>

10:37.920 --> 10:39.090
<b>Sure, but...</b>

10:39.090 --> 10:40.510
<b>What's it like there?!</b>

10:40.510 --> 10:41.510
<b>Uh-</b>

10:41.510 --> 10:43.720
<b>What other kinds of magic can you use?!</b>

10:43.720 --> 10:44.840
<b>Well, there's several-</b>

10:44.840 --> 10:47.720
<b>What other races are there
aside from elves?!</b>

10:48.340 --> 10:49.970
<b>Calm down.</b>

10:49.970 --> 10:52.130
<b>O-oh, sowwy...</b>

10:54.420 --> 10:56.130
<b>You remind me of a chipmunk.</b>

10:56.130 --> 10:58.720
<b>A chipmunk? Sewiously...?</b>

10:59.590 --> 11:03.550
<b>Well... I guess I'm just glad
she made a friend.</b>
